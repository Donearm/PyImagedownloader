Pyimagedownloader

Purpose of this program
----

Pyimagedownloader is an image downloader written in Python. It downloads
all the images hosted on the supported imagehosting sites (see Supported
Host List) present on the given url and puts them all in a directory with the
page title name. It's geared towards those people that download images
to share them afterwards on their blogs or on forums. It automatically
saves the link of the page with the images as a source to cite the
original poster or can optionally save the name of the person to whom
give credit to in a separate file.

It also downloads images posted in one of the supported forum or sites
(see Supported Forum/Sites List) given that you have a valid login (user
+ password) and put it in the config file (pyimg.py). Those supported
are just what I regularly use, more could be added.


Installation
----

Most of the time a simple `python build/setup.py install` should 
suffice. See http://docs.python.org/install/index.html
